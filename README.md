**[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy)** is **[Zigbee protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee)** integration project to implement the **[Zigbee Home Automation](https://www.zigbee.org/)** standard as a Python 3 library. 

Zigbee Home Automation integration with zigpy allows you to connect one of many off-the-shelf Zigbee adapters using one of the available Zigbee radio library modules compatible with zigpy to control Zigbee based devices. There is currently support for controlling Zigbee device types such as binary sensors (e.g., motion and door sensors), sensors (e.g., temperature sensors), lightbulbs, switches, and fans.

Zigbee coordinator hardware from many different hardware manufacturers are supported via radio libraries which translate their proprietary communication protocol into a common API which is shared among all radio libraries for zigpy. If some Zigbee coordinator hardware for other manufacturers is not supported by yet zigpy it is possible for any independent developer to step-up and develop a new radio library for zigpy which translates its proprietary communication protocol into the common API that zigpy can understand.

zigpy contains common code implementing Zigbee ZCL, ZDO and application state management which is being used by various radio libraries implementing the actual interface with the radio modules from different manufacturers. The separate radio libraries interface with radio hardware adapters/modules over USB and GPIO using different native UART serial protocols.

Reference implementation of the zigpy library exist in **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** (Python based open source home automation software) as part of its **[ZHA integration component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/)**.

### Zigbee device OTA updates

zigpy have code to automatically download and perform OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates of Zigbee devices if the OTA firmware image provider source URL for updates is known. The OTA update directory is optional and it can also be used for any offline firmware files that you provide yourself.

Online OTA providers for firmware updates are currently only available for IKEA and LEDVANCE devices. OTA updates for device of other manufactures could possible also be supported by zigpy in the future, if these manufacturers publish their device OTA firmware images publicly.

## Compatible Zigbee coordinator hardware

Radio libraries for zigpy are separate projects with their own repositories and include **[bellows](https://github.com/zigpy/bellows)** (for communicating with Silicon Labs EmberZNet based radios), **[zigpy-deconz](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-deconz)** (for communicating with deCONZ based radios from Dresden Elektronik), and **[zigpy-xbee](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-xbee)** (for communicating with XBee based Zigbee radios), **[zigpy-zigate](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-zigate)** for communicating with ZiGate based radios, **[zigpy-znp](https://github.com/zha-ng/zigpy-znp)** or **[zigpy-cc](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-cc)** for communicating with Texas Instruments based radios that have Z-Stack ZNP coordinator firmware.

Note! Zigbee 3.0 support or not in zigpy depends primarily on your Zigbee coordinator hardware and its firmware. Some Zigbee coordinator hardware support Zigbee 3.0 but might be shipped with an older firmware which does not, in which case may want to upgrade the firmware manually yourself. Some other Zigbee coordinator hardware may not support a firmware that is capable of Zigbee 3.0 at all but can still be fully functional and feature complete for your needs, (this is very common as many if not most Zigbee devices do not yet Zigbee 3.0 or are backwards-compable with a Zigbee profile that is support by your Zigbee coordinator hardware and its firmware). As a general rule, newer Zigbee coordinator hardware released can normally support Zigbee 3.0 firmware and it is up to its manufacturer to make such firmware available for them.

### zigpy-cli (zigpy command line interface)
[zigpy-cli](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-cli) is a unified command line interface for zigpy radios. The goal of this project is to allow low-level network management from an intuitive command line interface and to group useful Zigbee tools into a single binary.

### ZHA Device Handlers
ZHA deviation handling in Home Assistant relies on the third-party [ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers) project. Zigbee devices that deviate from or do not fully conform to the standard specifications set by the [Zigbee Alliance](https://www.zigbee.org) may require the development of custom [ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers) (ZHA custom quirks handler implementation) to for all their functions to work properly with the ZHA component in Home Assistant. These ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant can thus be used to parse custom messages to and from non-compliant Zigbee devices. The custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant are a similar concept to that of [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/) as well as that of [zigbee-herdsman converters as used by Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_support_new_devices.html), meaning they are each virtual representations of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms.

### ZHA integration component for Home Assistant
[ZHA integration component for Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) is a reference implementation of the zigpy library as integrated into the core of **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** (a Python based open source home automation software). There are also other GUI and non-GUI projects for Home Assistant's ZHA components which builds on or depends on its features and functions to enhance or improve its user-experience, some of those are listed and linked below.

This enables developers and testers to test new or updated zigpy radio modules without having to modify the Home Assistant source code.

#### Zigpy Deconz Parser
[zigpy-deconz-parser](https://github.com/zha-ng/zigpy-deconz-parser) allow you to parse Home Assistant's ZHA component debug log using `zigpy-deconz` library if you are using a deCONZ based adapter like ConBee or RaspBee.

### ZigCoHTTP
[ZigCoHTTP](https://github.com/daniel17903/ZigCoHTTP) is a stand-alone python application project that creates a ZigBee network using zigpy and bellows. ZigBee devices joining this network can be controlled via a HTTP API. It was developed for a Raspberry Pi using a [Matrix Creator Board](https://www.matrix.one/products/creator) but should also work with other computers with Silicon Labs Zigbee hardware, or with other Zigbee hardware if replace bellows with other radio library for zigpy.
